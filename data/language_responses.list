rust is bae
{languages} is better than {trigger}
only {insults}s use {trigger}
@{user} why would you use {trigger}??  
"{trigger_message}" deez nuts
Not a fan of the syntax for {trigger}
What are some good tutorials for {trigger}? 
"{trigger_message}" what are you, a {insults}?
where did you first learn about {trigger}, @{user}?
Any good books for {trigger}?
How do i make money with {trigger}
people that use {trigger} and {languages} really are {insults}
I need a break from {trigger}, maybe ill try {languages}
I need a break from {trigger}, are there any good alternatives?
